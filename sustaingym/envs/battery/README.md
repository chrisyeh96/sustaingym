## Generators and Battery Systems

We downloaded the list of actual power plants and battery systems from the [California Energy Commission website](https://cecgis-caenergy.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/4a702cd67be24ae7ab8173423a768e1b_0/explore) on July 28, 2022.

**Dispatchable Generators**

We restricted the list of dispatchable power plants to the Southern California Edison (SCE) utility, then randomly sampled 10 generators.

Ellwood Generating Station     | 56.7          | natural gas (NG)

**Battery Storage Systems**

We restricted the list of battery storage systems to the Southern California region. There were exactly 5 such generators. Rates (MW) are provided by the California Energy Commission. Capacities (MWh) were found from Google Searches.
