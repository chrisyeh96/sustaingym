## EV Charging

We downloaded EV charging data from the [Adaptive Charging Network website](https://ev.caltech.edu/dataset)
on September 16, 2022. The default Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) were then
trained using train_gmm_model.py. The charging data is made possible from a
close collaboration between Caltech and PowerFlex, and the gym currently
supports the Caltech (54 charging stations) and JPL (52 charging stations)
sites.
